# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). No third party repositories were used than scss, all the animation and styling are done custom through css.

## Process

In the project dir install dependencies by running:

### `yarn install`

Then to start the application run:

### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
